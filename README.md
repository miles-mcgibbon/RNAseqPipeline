# RNAseq Differential Expression Bash Pipeline

This repo contains code for a pipeline to detect and annotate upregulated genes from multiple RNAseq samples from different samples that have undergone different treatments. Due to the high number of dependencies (fastqc, bowtie2, samtools & bedtools) the setup and deployment of this pipeline as a general purpose pipeline is a work in progress. I am working on creating documentation and creating a general setup bash script which will install all the required dependencies.
